          <h3 class="faq-question">Is Golden Flame really free to play?</h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Yes! Golden Flame: Co-op Puzzle Adventure is completely free to
            play. There are no hidden fees, no pay-to-win systems, and no locked
            levels behind a paywall. We believe in delivering a fully immersive
            puzzle experience for everyone. You can enjoy the entire adventure
            from start to finish without spending a single cent. The only thing
            you’ll need is your brain and maybe a partner! Future expansions may
            be released, but the core game will always remain free.

          <h3 class="faq-question">
            Can I play solo, or do I need a second player?
          </h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            You can absolutely play solo. Golden Flame was designed to work
            perfectly in both co-op and single-player modes. When playing solo,
            you’ll alternate control between Aru and Kai using a simple swap
            mechanic. The puzzles are balanced so that both styles of play offer
            a smooth and rewarding experience. However, solving puzzles with a
            friend may bring an extra layer of fun, laughter, and maybe even a
            few good-natured arguments!

          </h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Golden Flame runs directly in your browser — no downloads required.
            It’s built using modern web technologies and optimized for seamless
            gameplay across most devices. You just click “Play,” and you’re
            instantly transported into the Flame Temple. All saves are handled
            in-browser or via your player account (optional). If you choose to
            play on mobile, everything runs just as smoothly!

          <p class="faq-answer">
            Golden Flame is currently available on PC, Mac, tablets, and most
            smartphones through your browser. Whether you're using Chrome,
            Firefox, Safari, or Edge, the game is fully supported. We’re also
            working on controller support for those who want that console-like
            feel. A downloadable version might be released in the future if
            there’s demand. For now, all you need is an internet connection and
            a curiosity for fire-powered puzzles.

          </h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            A typical run of the game takes about 2–3 hours to complete,
            depending on how quickly you solve the puzzles. Some players breeze
            through with fast teamwork, while others take their time exploring
            every hidden corner of the temple. There are optional lore
            collectibles and alternate endings that can add replay value. We
            also include a time trial mode if you're into speedrunning. Expect
            more content in future updates as well.

          </h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Absolutely! Golden Flame is a great introduction to gaming for new
            players. The controls are simple, and the puzzle mechanics are
            intuitive without being overly complicated. We include helpful
            tooltips, visual cues, and beginner-friendly tutorials at the start.
            Plus, playing with a patient partner makes it an even better bonding
            experience. Many of our players say they introduced their friends,
            partners, or family to games through Golden Flame.

            Is the game suitable for kids or families?
          </h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Yes, Golden Flame is family-friendly and safe for players of all
            ages. The game does not include any violence, gore, or inappropriate
            content. It focuses on critical thinking, teamwork, and exploration.
            Many families play the game together, with kids solving puzzles and
            adults helping out with logic-heavy sections. That said, younger
            children may need assistance with more advanced puzzle levels.

          <h3 class="faq-question">What kind of puzzles are in the game?</h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            The puzzles in Golden Flame range from light-based mechanics like
            mirror redirection to cooperative lever pulls, flame sequencing,
            torch relays, and environmental navigation. Some puzzles are
            time-based, requiring coordination between both players, while
            others are logic-driven or spatial. No two puzzles are exactly the
            same, and new mechanics are introduced gradually to keep things
            fresh. We’ve designed the difficulty curve to be gentle, with plenty
            of hints built into the environment.

          <h3 class="faq-question">Is there a story or just puzzles?</h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Golden Flame is more than just a puzzle game — it’s a narrative
            adventure. As you explore the temple, you’ll uncover the ancient
            history of the Golden Flame and the civilization that once protected
            it. Through glowing glyphs, character banter, and secret lore rooms,
            you piece together a story of sacrifice, magic, and hope. The game
            features multiple endings depending on how much of the story you
            uncover. It’s subtle but deeply rewarding for players who love a bit
            of mystery.

          <p class="faq-answer">
            Yes, your progress is automatically saved as you play. Whether
            you're playing alone or with a friend, the game remembers your
            puzzle states and checkpoints. You can return at any time and
            continue right where you left off. If you play with a friend using a
            shared link, your session can be resumed as long as both players use
            the same devices. Account creation is optional but allows for cloud
            saves across devices.

            Yes! We plan to release seasonal events, new puzzle zones, and
            possibly a sequel depending on player interest. We’re also working
            on community features like leaderboards, challenge modes, and maybe
            even a level editor. We love feedback and are listening closely to
            our player community. Follow us on social media or sign up for our
            newsletter to stay updated. The temple may be ancient, but its
            future is just heating up!
